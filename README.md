# Secure Authentication Server with JWT

This project implements a secure authentication server using Java Spring Boot. It leverages Spring Security and a MySQL database to manage user credentials and generate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authorized users. Users can authenticate using email, password, and a one-time password (OTP) for enhanced security.

## Key Features:

* Secure user authentication with email, password, and OTP.
* JWT token generation for authorized users.
* Spring Boot framework for efficient development.
* Spring Security for robust access control.
* MySQL database for user data management.

## Benefits:

* Provides a secure and centralized authentication system.
* Enables token-based authorization for other applications.
* Scalable and adaptable for future needs.

This project showcases expertise in Java, Spring technologies, and security best practices. It's ideal for demonstrating backend development skills and understanding of modern authentication protocols.
